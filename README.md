# DAemon
This is a data analytics project based on the 2015 flight delays and cancellation dataset.

# Visualizations 
This program goes through various visualizations on the dataset like the distributions of the departure delays per airline, the distributions of flights for each airline, the number of airports visited by each airline and the comparison of the departure delay and arrival delay of different airlines

# Data analytics
This program analyzes the structure of the dataset and checks the amount of values in each column, the number of missing values in the complete dataset and it also provides different visualizations like box plots of the delay times per airlines, which help us gauge the few airlines that have a very high amount of delay time, graphs showing the market shares of different airlines and also a colour map showing the number of flights each airlines has for each month.

# Model January (March/June/December)
This program contains the final model. First this program goes through the preprocessing stages like changing the formats of the dates from the original dataset, adding datetime objects to the dataset and dropping the variables that we donâ€™t desire, after this we group our data based on the destination airport and provide the dataset as input to the model.
The model cycles through various values of alpha and n for ridge and polynomial regression respectively and finally settles on the combination that gives us the lowest mean squared error.Finally we use this model to test on the remaining data and validate our results.
